## Welcome to the Game Boy hardware database

This site contains data and photos of various types of Game Boy consoles, which
can be useful for many reasons.

You can

- Make educated guesses about hardware versions based on serial numbers. Maybe
  you want to know if that beautiful Game Boy Color on ebay has sound issues in
  some games (e.g. Final Fantasy Adventure)
- Use circuit board photos as a reference when modding or repairing your own
  console. This site has photos of almost all board versions
- Check which chips were used in Game Boy devices
- Study what improvements or cost savings were done in later board revisions of a Game Boy model
- Laugh or cry at photos of Game Boys which are in a worse shape than yours
- Download big CSV files for data analysis purposes
