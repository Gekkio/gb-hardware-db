## Game cartridge contribution instructions

### Taking photos of the cartridge

Cartridge submissions require three primary photos of the cartridge: one front
photo of the shell and label, one front photo of the circuit board, and one
back photo of the circuit board.  In the circuit board photos, the labels of
the main chips should be visible.

Here are some general tips for taking good photos:

* Good lighting and focus is much more important than the amount of megapixels
  in your camera/smartphone
* Taking photos during daytime with ambient lighting (but no direct sunlight)
  usually gives good results
* If you're too close to the subject, you can get blurry photos (unless you are
  using macro mode or equivalent). Focus is more important than megapixels, so
  move back a bit!
* Consider using a clean piece of white paper (e.g. printer paper) as a
  background in the photo

#### Extra photos for chip labels

If you find it difficult to get a good photo of the circuit board with all chip
labels visible, you can just take a decent primary photo and include extra
photos of the chips in the submission. As long as all main chips have visible
labels in *some photos*, it's ok if the primary photo is not perfect.

### Identifying the cartridge stamp code

Almost every official genuine cartridge has a stamped code on its label
consisting of two digits and optionally one letter. This information is not
usually visible in the main photo, so it has to be collected separately.
Identify the stamp code and include the stamp in the submission in some way,
for example by writing it in a .txt file and including it in the submission.

The stamp is sometimes very difficult to see, especially if the label has a
complicated picture instead of large areas with solid colours:

![Cartridge stamp example, not visible](/cart_stamp_invisible.jpg)  
This cartridge has stamp code "00A", but it's not visible in the photo.

If you find it difficult to see the stamp, try using a strong light source and
looking at the cartridge from different angles. Here are some photos of the
previous example cart from different angles, and the stamp code highlighted
with blue colour:

### Sending the submission

Once you have taken a set of photos and identified the stamp code, upload them
somewhere (e.g. Google Drive) and send me (Gekkio) a link via
E-mail/Discord/Twitter.

### Examples of *bad* photos

![Bad photo 1](/cart_bad_1.jpg)  
This photo is completely terrible and worthless. Never send photos like this.

![Bad photo 2](/cart_bad_2.jpg)  
This photo is too dark, and the chip labels are not visible.

![Bad photo 3](/cart_bad_3.jpg)  
This photo was obviously taken with flash on, because the lighting is very
uneven. Using flash is not always bad, and the main problem in this photo is
that chip labels are not readable. For example, the label of the chip on the
right (U1) is not visible at all.

### Examples of *good* photos

![Good photo 1](/cart_good_1.jpg)
![Good photo 2](/cart_good_2.jpg)
![Good photo 3](/cart_good_3.jpg)  

These photos are perfect: perfectly in focus, nice even lighting, white
background, and all chip labels are visible.
